## Topics

There are four areas covered at each SAC conference. Three of the areas are permanent.

1. Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems, including block and stream ciphers, hash function, MAC algorithms, cryptographic permutations, and authenticated encryption schemes;
2. Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms; and
3. Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology.

The special selected topic for SAC {{ site.data.variables.year }} is:

{:start="4"}
4. {{ site.data.variables.fourth_topic }}.

SAC {{ site.data.variables.year }} also welcomes papers in any of the areas above with a focus on post-quantum cryptography.

## Virtual participation (updated on August 13, 2023)

Due to the delay of getting a Canada visa, we had to accomodate a number of talks virtually via Zoom at the last moment. If you plan to attend the conference virtually, an email should be sent to [{{ site.data.variables.organizer_email }}](mailto:{{ site.data.variables.organizer_email }}) for registration.
