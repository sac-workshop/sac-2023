    time: 11:35 AM - 12:30 PM
    location: DC 1302
    speaker: Tetsu Iwata
    affiliation: Nagoya University
    details: Provable security results guarantee the security of block cipher modes of operation. However, we have witnessed several cases where security proofs of standardized modes of operation have been found to be wrong or contain a gap. In some cases, the proof can be repaired without changing the scheme, or sometimes the tiny gap in the proof triggers various attacks on the scheme. In this talk, we review several cases and discuss ways to improve the situation.
