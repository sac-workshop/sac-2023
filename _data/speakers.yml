  bio: 
  #- Tetsu Iwata is an Associate Professor at Nagoya University, Japan. He works on design and analysis of various symmetric key cryptosystems. He is one of the designers of CMAC (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code), which was adopted by NIST as a recommended block cipher mode of operation in 2005. In recent years, he is also interested in quantum security of symmetric key cryptosystems. He was the general co-chair of FSE 2017, and the program co-chairs of FSE 2010, Asiacrypt 2014, and Asiacrypt 2015.

  title: Professor, Faculty of Mathematics
  affiliation:  University of Waterloo
  bio: 
  - David Jao received his Ph.D in Mathematics from Harvard University in 2003. From 2003 to 2006, he worked in the Cryptography and Anti-Piracy Group at Microsoft Research, contributing cryptographic software modules for several Microsoft products. He is currently a professor in the Mathematics Faculty at the University of Waterloo. His research interests include elliptic curve cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, protocol design, and implementation. Prof. Jao is one of the inventors of isogeny-based cryptography and principal submitter of the SIKE cryptosystem, which advanced to round 4 of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process before being broken in 2022. 
  #- Seny Kamara is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. Before joining Brown, he was a researcher at Microsoft Research (Redmond Lab). His research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from privacy, security and surveillance. His primary focus is on the design and cryptanalysis of encrypted algorithms, which are efficient algorithms that operate on end-to-end encrypted data. He maintains interests in various aspects of theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data structures and algorithms, data systems, algorithmic fairness, game theory and technology policy.
