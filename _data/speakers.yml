  title: Associate Professor
  affiliation: Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven
  bio: 
  - Nele Mentens received her master and PhD degree from Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven in 2003 and 2007, respectively. Her PhD focused on secure and efficient coprocessor design for cryptographic applications on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Currently, Nele is an associate professor at KU Leuven and an academic staff member of the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research group.
  - Her research interests are in the domains of reconfigurable platforms for security applications, and embedded security in constrained environments. Nele was a visiting researcher for three months at the Ruhr University Bochum in 2013 and at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in 2017. She was/is the principal investigator in around 15 finished and ongoing research projects with national and international funding. She serves as a program committee member of renowned international conferences on security and hardware design, such as Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, Selected Areas in Cryptography, Design, Automation, and Test in Europe, Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) and Embedded Systems Week. She was the general co-chair of FPL in 2017 and the program chair of European Workshop on Microelectronics Education and International Workshop on Security Proofs for Embedded Systems in 2018. Nele is a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and serves as an expert for the European Commission.
