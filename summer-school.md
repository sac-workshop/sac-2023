# SAC Summer School

The purpose of the Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) Summer School is to provide participants with an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of specific areas of cryptography related to the current SAC topics by bringing together world-class researchers who will give extended talks (half-day) in their areas of specialty. The SAC Summer School is open to all attendees, and may be of particular interest to students, postdoctoral fellows, and other early-career researchers.

The SAC Summer School will be held prior to SAC, on **August 12-13, 2019**, at the University of Waterloo.

## Registration

The registration fee for the SAC Summer School is $40 for regular attendees and $20 for students. [Register today.](registration.html)
