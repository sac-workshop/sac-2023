# SAC Summer School

The purpose of the Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) Summer School is to provide participants with an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of specific areas of cryptography related to the current SAC topics by bringing together world-class researchers who will give extended talks (half-day) in their areas of specialty. The SAC Summer School is open to all attendees, and may be of particular interest to students, postdoctoral fellows, and other early-career researchers.

The SAC Summer School will be held prior to SAC, on **{{ site.data.variables.dates_school }}**, at {{ site.data.variables.location }}.
