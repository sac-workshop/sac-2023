#### Visas

Non-Canadian conference attendees should check Canada's current entry requirements in advance of their travel. In particular, there is a new entry requirement that:

*"Visa-exempt foreign nationals are expected to have an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to fly to or transit through Canada.  Exceptions include U.S. citizens, and travelers with a valid Canadian visa. Canadian citizens, including dual citizens, and Canadian permanent residents cannot apply for an eTA."*

[Click here](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) to determine whether you need an eTA, visitor visa, or nothing at all.

Check out [Visit Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/) for details on border information, extending your stay and more.

Submitters who may require a visa are encouraged to begin the process early, and in particular, can contact the organizers after submission, but prior to the notification deadline to request a letter of submission.
